# **Interactive Shape Game**

## **Overview**
This project is a **Windows Forms application** that offers an interactive game by incorporating various geometric shapes. Users interact with shapes such as circles, squares, rectangles and parallelograms, with dynamic visual effects and gameplay mechanics.

## **Key Features**

### 1. **Object-Oriented Design**  
- Utilizes abstract classes and inheritance to define different geometric shapes. 
- Each shape has properties like position, color and highlighting, making it easy to extend or modify.

### 2. **Interactive Gameplay**  
- Allow users to interact with shapes that are drawn on the canvas, providing feedback when shapes are clicked. 
- Includes shapes like circles, squares, parallelograms, and rectangles, each with customized behaviors and properties.

### 3. **Scoring and Leveling System**  
- Features a dynamic scoring system where players earn points by clicking on specific shapes. 
- As the score increases, players level up, changing the gameplay difficulty and time limits.

### 4. **Sound Effects**  
- Integrates sound effects to enhance user experience during actions like popping shapes, winning and incorrect interactions.

### 5. **Game Logic Management**  
- A `GameManager` class handles the game's rules, including scoring, level progression and remaining time.
- Includes a game-over condition with an option to restart the game, ensuring ongoing enjoyment.

### 6. **Code Reusability and Extensibility**  
- Utilizes modular and reusable code to make it easy to add more shapes or modify the game logic.
- Implements clean programming practices and separation, making the codebase maintainable.
