# **Interactive Shape-Based Game**

This project is a Windows Forms application designed to offer an interactive game by incorporating various geometric shapes. Users can interact with shapes such as circles, squares, rectangles and parallelograms, with dynamic visual effects and gameplay mechanics.

---

## **Key Features**

### 1. **Object-Oriented Design**  
- Utilizes abstract classes and inheritance to define different geometric shapes. 
- Each shape has properties like position, color and highlighting, making it easy to extend or modify.

### 2. **Interactive Gameplay**  
- Users can interact with shapes that are drawn on the canvas, with feedback provided when shapes are clicked.
- The shapes include a circle, square, parallelogram and rectangle, each with customized behaviors and properties.

### 3. **Scoring and Leveling System**  
- Features a dynamic scoring system where players earn points by clicking on specific shapes.
- As the score increases, players level up, changing the gameplay difficulty and time limits.

### 4. **Sound Effects**  
- Integrated sound effects to enhance user experience during actions like popping shapes, winning and incorrect interactions.
- Custom audio files are used for actions like “win”, “lose”, and “wrong” to provide immediate feedback.

### 5. **Game Logic Management**  
- A `GameManager` class handles the game's rules, including scoring, level progression and remaining time. 
- Features a game-over condition with an option to restart the game, ensuring ongoing enjoyment for the player.

### 6. **Code Reusability and Extensibility**  
- Designed with modular and reusable code to make it easy to add more shapes or modify the game logic.
- Emphasis on clean programming practices and separation of concerns, making the codebase maintainable.
